# PROJECT TITLE : PLANT DISEASE DETECTION FROM LEAF IMAGES
## CLEAR PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop an application for a plant disease detection system using leaf images. The system will be designed to identify and classify different diseases affecting leaves of plants like apples, cherries, corn, grapes, oranges, soybeans, squash, and strawberries.
### Motivation:
Plants are a significant source of food for the world population. Plant diseases contribute to production loss, which can be solved with continuous monitoring. Detecting affected plants is one of the first steps in diagnosing a plant disease. Proper identification of the disease and the disease-causing agent, and disease control measures are necessary to save time and money.
### Method: 
The proposed approach involves leveraging deep learning techniques for image classification. The model will be trained on a diverse dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves to enable accurate disease classification.

## INTERESTING CHOICE OF PROBLEM 
The problem of plant disease detection from leaf images is attractive due to its real-world impact on agriculture. Building an application will help not only the farmers but also the agricultural experts to identify new diseases spreading in a particular area. This also enables researchers to implement timely and effective remedial measures. The convergence of computer vision, agriculture, and machine learning in this pursuit makes it a multifaceted and highly relevant problem. The solution aims to seamlessly integrate technology and expertise, fostering a proactive approach towards mitigating the impact of plant diseases on crop yields and global food security.
